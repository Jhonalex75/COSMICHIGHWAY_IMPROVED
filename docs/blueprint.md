# **App Name**: Cosmic Highway

## Core Features:

- Solar System Visualization: Display an interactive 3D visualization of the solar system, including the Sun, major planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune), Earth, and the three interstellar asteroids (Oumuamua, Borisov, and Atlas).
- Asteroid Trajectory Animation: Animate the trajectories of the interstellar asteroids, visualizing their paths as they enter and exit the solar system.
- Trajectory Playback Controls: The user should be able to play/pause the trajectories.
- Asteroid Data Labels: Provide data labels for each asteroid (Oumuamua, Borisov, Atlas) including their name, semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, and classification based on eccentricity (e.g., hyperbolic).
- Color-Coded Trajectories: Use color-coded trajectories to differentiate the paths of each asteroid for clear visual distinction.
- AI Educational Insights: Use generative AI to dynamically generate educational insights about each asteroid's unique orbital characteristics, such as identifying the forces influencing them. Use this information to add further explanation of these bodies in pop-up windows when they are clicked. The LLM tool will use reasoning to decide if there's any interesting tidbit it should incorporate.
- Interactive Controls: Allow users to control the animation speed and zoom level to focus on specific areas or details of the simulation.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep space blue (#22274F) to evoke the vastness and mystery of space.
- Background color: Dark grayish-blue (#292D3E) to maintain contrast with the highlighted elements.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#BE82FA) to highlight interactive elements and draw attention.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for a techy, scientific feel suitable for both headers and labels.
- Use simple, line-based icons for interactive elements (play, pause, zoom) to maintain a clean interface.
- Maintain a minimalist layout, ensuring the 3D visualization is the focal point, with data labels and interactive controls arranged in a clear, non-intrusive manner.
- Implement smooth transitions and subtle animations for user interactions, such as zooming and asteroid trajectory animation, to provide a seamless experience.
